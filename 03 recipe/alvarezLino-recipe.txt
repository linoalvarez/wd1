            This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true
            tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h2>
        <p>There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the
                outside and juiciness on the inside
            </li>
            <li>
                Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however,
                only starts at very high heat â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up
                the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture
            </li>
            <li>
                Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crispy Fried Chicken Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make the best, crispiest fried chicken of your life:</p>

        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs,
            and/or thighs at the grocery store.
        </p>
   
        <h3>Buttermilk</h3>
        <p>
            Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick
            to the chicken.
        </p>
   
        <h3>Flour</h3>
        <p>
            All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully
            crispy crust
        </p>
   
        <h3>Seasoning</h3>
        <p>
            This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can
            add more spices and seasonings to taste.
        </p>
   
        <h3>Oil</h3>
        <p>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</p>

        <p>
            You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make
            this crispy fried chicken:
        </p>

        <h3>Make the Breading</h3>
        <p>
            Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined
        </p>

        <h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in
            buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer
            the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
        </p>
   
        <h3>Fry the Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat,
            cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until
            extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Store Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>
            Let the fried chicken cool before storage to prevent bacteria growth. Place it in a shallow airtight
            container
            or wrap it tightly in aluminum foil, then refrigerate for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or in the
            oven.

        <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
        <p>
            "Great recipe and great technique," raves Ebcook. "Had no idea letting batter become paste like and then
            covering while frying would make such a difference! Definitely a keeper."
        </p>
        <p>
            "[This recipe makes] crisp and juicy chicken every time," according to Nicole. "Made it twice now, both
            times
            turned outgreat. I marinate the chicken first for more flavor, but the actual frying technique works like a
            charm."
        </p>
        <p>
            "This is now my favorite fried chicken recipe," says Renee Ann Galvan. "The only thing I did differently was
            add
            garlic powder and crushed red pepper to give it a little heat."

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour
            you
            use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and
            shake to coat well.

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
            Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET
            SIT
            UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
            Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
            Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>
            When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but
            not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>
            Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a
            few
            shifts.
